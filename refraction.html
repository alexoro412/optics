                    <p>Certain materials, such as glass and water, allow light to pass through it, but slower than it would
                        in air or vacuum. The amount that is slowed down in a material is called the index of refraction
                        (IOR).

                    <p>
                        This slowing down causes light to bend, or refract, at the surface of the material. 
                        The angles for refraction can be calculated with Snell's Law.

                        Additionally, a small amount of light is also reflected. This is called <b>partial reflection</b>, and it's strength is determined by the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations#Power_(intensity)_reflection_and_transmission_coefficients">Fresnel equations.</a>
                        They are rather complicated, 
                        so just know that there is more partial reflection when light hits a material with a high IOR at a shallow angle. 
                        This is why when you look straight down at the ocean, it appears clear, but from a shallow angle, it appears reflective.

                        For example, when light starts in a material with a higher IOR than its surroundings, 
                        and hits the surface at a shallow enough angle, Snell's law provides no answer. 
                        When that happens, all of the light is reflected, which is called <b>total internal reflection.</b>

                        Compared to mirrors, refractive materials, like glass, 
                        behave the opposite way. While concave mirrors focus light,
                        concave glass spreads the light rays out. 
                        And while convex mirrors spread light out, convex glass 
                        focuses light. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can even see how the mirrors would have behaved 
                        with the partial reflection of the glass.

                    <p>
                        To the right is a lens made out of two arcs of a circle. 
                        A horizontal beam entering this lens gets refracted at each surface, 
                        and focused onto a point. You'll notice that if the beam doesn't hit the center of the lens, 
                        it is not focused very well. This is called <b>spherical aberration.</b> Unfortunately, 
                        the parabola cannot save us from this aberration like it did with mirrors. 
                        When spherical aberration needs to be eliminated, people will often turn 
                        to a more complicated lens, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens">Fresnel lens</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By changing the thickness, height, and IOR of the lens, you can change where the focal point is.
                        If you then take the cone lamp, and place it at the focal point, it will be focused into a horizontal beam.
                        This is how the lens in a laser point creates a tight beam.

                    <p>
                        This also shows a magnifying glass can be used to light things on fire. 
                        Simply focus the light from the sun onto the surface of the object,
                        and it will absorb the light as heat and catch fire.

                    <p>
                        To the right is a very simplified model of a moon (below), and a planet like Earth (above).
                        The atmosphere has a slightly higher 
                        refractive index than the vacuum around it. This causes 
                        it to bend the light that hits the atmosphere but misses the planet.
                        In reality, this refractive index would not be constant, but would vary 
                        with the altitude above the planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This refraction causes two phenomena. First, you can see the 
                        sun before it is rises. This is because some of the light rays 
                        coming from the sun get bent around the planet, and hit your eyes before 
                        the sun is really there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other phenomena is the shape of Earth's shadow. 
                        For most objects, like the moon, their shadows get larger the farther away from them you go.
                        But by bending the light, the darkest part of Earth's shadow (the umbra) actually gets smaller.
                        The area where the bent light travels, instead of being a full shadow,
                        is now only a partial shadow (the penumbra).

                    <h3 class="subtitle">One way glass</h3>
                    <p>
                        All glass is one way glass, to some degree.
                        In order to have one way glass, you just need 
                        one side to be very bright, and the other very dark. 
                        On the bright side, 
                        the partial reflection from the bright light 
                        will outshine any light transmitted through the glass 
                        from the dark side, making that side look like a mirror.
                        On the dark side, the bright light transmitted through 
                        the glass will outshine the partial reflection 
                        from the dark light.
                         
                        You can try this to the right, and see that the brighter 
                        light tends to be more visible on both sides of the glass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For actual one way glass, like in interrogation rooms,
                        they often boost the partial reflection 
                        of the glass by either coating it with a thin layer of metal, or encasing 
                        the metal inside the glass (as shown to the right). 
                        This metal is so thin that it's translucent, but still quite reflective, 
                        which helps to reflect the light from the bright side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, if you're ever stuck in an interrogation room,
                        and need to see through the one way glass, 
                        you could try to put your eyes right up on the glass, and cup 
                        your hands around them for a bit of shade.

                    <p>
                        One nice aspect of total internal reflection is the word total. Unlike mirrors, which absorb a 
                        bit of light with every reflection, no light is absorbed in total internal reflection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To the right are two potential designs for cables that can carry light, much like 
                        how wires can carry electricity. You could use these cables to send information quickly 
                        over long distances. 
                        On the right is one made of mirrors, and on the left is one of glass. 
                        The mirror cable has a bit higher of absorption than normal, just to show what would 
                        happen over long distances. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, the cable made of mirrors will start to absorb 
                        so much light that barely any makes it through. The glass cable, on the other hand, lets the 
                        light through at full strength, though it can lose some around sharp bends.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The glass cable, because it loses so little light,<sup class="tooltip is-tooltip-right is-tooltip-multiline" data-tooltip="In messy reality, tiny imperfections in the glass cable do cause it to lose some light over distance">*</sup> is the preferred one for communication uses. 
                        These kinds of glass cables are called fiber optic cables, and they are 
                        used to connect large portions of the internet.<sup class="tooltip is-tooltip-right is-tooltip-multiline" data-tooltip="This is where the fiber in Google Fiber comes from">*</sup>
