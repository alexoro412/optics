                    <p>Certain materials, such as glass and water, allow light to pass through it, but slower than it would
                        in air or vacuum. The amount that is slowed down in a material is called the index of refraction
                        (IOR).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This slowing down causes light to bend, or refract, at the surface of the material. 
                        The angles for refraction can be calculated with Snell's Law.

                        Additionally, a small amount of light is also reflected. This is called <b>partial reflection</b>, and it's strength is determined by the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations#Power_(intensity)_reflection_and_transmission_coefficients">Fresnel equations.</a>
                        They are rather complicated, 
                        so just know that there is more partial reflection when light hits a material with a high IOR at a shallow angle. 
                        This is why when you look straight down at the ocean, it appears clear, but from a shallow angle, it appears reflective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Snell's law does not always give an answer. For example, when light starts in a material with a higher IOR than the surroundings, 
                        and hits the surface at a shallow enough angle, Snell's law provides no answer. 
                        In that case, all of the light is reflected. This is called <b>total internal reflection.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll look into each of these phenomena separately below.

                    <p>
                        To the right is a lens made out of two arcs of a circle. 
                        A horizontal beam entering this lens gets refracted at each surface, 
                        and focused onto a point. You'll notice that if the beam doesn't hit the center of the lens, 
                        it is not focused as well. This is called <b>spherical aberration</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By changing the thickness, height, and IOR of the lens, you can change where the focal point is.
                        If you then take the cone lamp, and place it at the focal point, it will be focused into a horizontal beam.
                        This is how the lens in a laser point creates a beam.

                    <p>
                        This also shows a magnifying glass can be used to light things on fire. 
                        Simply focus the light from the sun onto the surface of the object,
                        and it will absorb the light as heat and catch fire.

                    <p>
                        All glass is one way glass, to some degree.
                        In order to have one way glass, you just need 
                        one side to be very bright, and the other very dark. 
                        On the bright side, 
                        the partial reflection from the bright light 
                        will outshine any light transmitted through the glass 
                        from the dark side, making that side look metallic.
                        One the dark side, the bright light transmitted through 
                        the glass will outshine the partial reflection 
                        from the dark light.
                         
                        You can try this to the right, and see that the brighter 
                        light tends to be more visible on both sides of the glass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For actual one way glass, like in interrogation rooms,
                        they often boost the partial reflection 
                        of the glass by either coating it with a thin layer of metal, or encasing 
                        the metal inside the glass (as shown to the right). 
                        This metal is so thin that it's translucent, but still quite reflective, 
                        which helps reflect the light from the bright side.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, if you're ever stuck in an interrogation room,
                        and need to see through the one way glass, 
                        you could put your eyes right up on the glass, and cup 
                        your hands around them for a bit of shade.
