                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>When light hits a mirror, it reflects out at the same angle that it hit the mirror at. This angle is measured
                    off of the normal vector, which is perpendicular to the surface of the mirror. Try moving the light ray
                    to the right to see reflection in action. </p>

                    The angle with which light hits the mirror (θ<sub>i</sub>) is the same as the angle it reflects out at (θ<sub>r</sub>).

                <p>
                    Light hitting a curved mirror can get a bit more complicated.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When the rays hit a concave part of the mirror, it focuses the light onto a point. The rays also flip which side of the beam
                    they're on. This is why when you look into a spoon, your reflection is flipped. Try hovering over the
                    rays to see this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the light hits a convex part of the mirror, it tends to spread out, and the rays don't flip. This is why convex mirrors
                    and more boring than concave mirrors.

                <h3> More curved mirrors </h3>
                <p>
                    Here's another curved mirror to play with. This one's been modified to not be perfectly reflective. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, it only reflects
                    <b id="percent-reflectance">50%</b> of the light that hits it. It lets another
                    <b id="percent-transmission">10%</b> through, and the absorbs the other
                    <b id="percent-absorbance">40%</b>. The absorbed light gets turned into heat, which can melt mirrors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real mirrors tend to have reflectances within 80% - 99%.

                <h3>Focusing Light</h3>
                <p>
                    Since curved mirrors focus light, you could use a half circle to focus a beam onto a point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, as you can see to the right, not all of the light is focused. Most rays just bounce out of the circle entirely. The
                    rays that do hit the focus don't focus into a point, but rather into a heart like shape (cardioid). This is more visible 
                    when the radius of the circle is smaller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact that a circle doesn't perfectly focus light is called <b>spherical aberration</b>. It can be minimized by only using the
                    bottom part of the circle.

                <h3>The Parabola</h3>
                <p>
                    The parabola is another choice for focusing light, and as you will see, it focuses light far better than the circle. <!--In fact, it can be mathematically
                    proven that every light ray coming down vertically onto a parabola will all be reflected towards the
 same point, the parabola's focal point.--> 
<!-- <sup class="footnote" data-balloon="Here's a great video that proves that, if you want" data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon-pos="up">
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owVwjr6pTqc">[1]</a>
</sup> -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see how the parabola focuses light by trying out the vertical beam (left). The light rays will all focus
                    onto the parabolas focal point. You can change how far away that point is with the slider below. 
                </p>
                <p>
 Then, try the cone lamp (right) and position it at the focal point. If you get it close enough, the lamp's rays should all
be reflected to form a vertical beam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- You can take that beam, and focus it back down with another parabola. You can try that below. I've limited the number of
                    times each light ray can get reflected, just so things don't get to messy. -->
                    Below, you can try using this property to focus light from one parabola onto another. 
 I've limited the number of times each light ray can get reflected, just so things don't get to messy.

                <h3>Satellite Dishes</h3>
                <p>
                    The simulation above shows how satellite dishes work. Satellite dishes are 3D parabolas, which are called parabaloids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That piece at the end of the rod is the transceiver. It can emit and detect radio waves, which are a kind of light that
                    we humans can't see naturally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transceiver positioned at the parabola's focal point. When two dishes are pointed at each other, any light from one
                    of them will be focused into a beam that hits the other dish, where it gets focused onto the receiver.

                <p>
                    Now you can try playing around with light rays inside a circular mirror. It makes pretty patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality, the rays would keep bouncing, but to keep your computer happy, these ones can only bounce 10 times.
