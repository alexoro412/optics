                        Light hitting a curved mirror can get a bit more complicated.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the rays hit a concave part of the mirror, it focuses the light onto a point. The rays also flip which side of the beam
                        they're on. This is why when you look into a spoon, your reflection is flipped. Try hovering over
                        the rays to see this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the light hits a convex part of the mirror, it tends to spread out, and the rays don't flip. This is why convex mirrors
                        and more boring than concave mirrors.

                        Here's another curved mirror to play with. This one's been modified to not be perfectly reflective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, it only reflects
                        <b id="percent-reflectance">50%</b> of the light that hits it. It lets another
                        <b id="percent-transmission">10%</b> through, and the absorbs the other
                        <b id="percent-absorbance">40%</b>. The absorbed light gets turned into heat, which can melt mirrors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Real mirrors tend to have reflectances within 80% - 99%.

                    <h3 class="title">Focusing Light</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since curved mirrors focus light, you could use a half circle to focus a beam onto a point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, as you can see to the right, not all of the light is focused. Most rays just bounce out of the circle entirely. The
                        rays that do hit the focus don't focus into a point, but rather into a heart like shape (cardioid).
                        This is more visible when the radius of the circle is smaller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that a circle doesn't perfectly focus light is called
                        <b>spherical aberration</b>. It can be minimized by only using the bottom part of the circle.

                    <h3 class="title">The Parabola</h3>
                    <p>
                        The parabola is another choice for focusing light, and as you will see, it focuses light far better than the circle.
                        <!--In fact, it can be mathematically
                    proven that every light ray coming down vertically onto a parabola will all be reflected towards the
 same point, the parabola's focal point.-->
                        <!-- <sup class="footnote" data-balloon="Here's a great video that proves that, if you want" data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon-pos="up">

</sup> -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can see how the parabola focuses light by trying out the vertical beam (left). The light rays will all focus onto the
                        parabolas focal point. You can change how far away that point is with the slider below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, try the cone lamp (right) and position it at the focal point. If you get it close enough, the lamp's rays should all
                        be reflected to form a vertical beam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- You can take that beam, and focus it back down with another parabola. You can try that below. I've limited the number of
                    times each light ray can get reflected, just so things don't get to messy. -->
                        Below, you can try using this property to focus light from one parabola onto another. I've limited the number of times each
                        light ray can get reflected, just so things don't get to messy.

                    <p>
                        The simulation above shows how satellite dishes work. Satellite dishes are 3D parabolas, which are called parabaloids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every satellite dish has a rod that sticks out from it. At the end of the rod is the transceiver. It can emit and detect
                        radio waves, which are a kind of light that we humans can't see naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rod is used to position the transceiver at the parabola's focal point, so it can easily pick up all incoming light. When
                        two dishes are pointed at each other, any light from one of them will be focused into a beam that
                        hits the other dish, where it gets focused onto the other's receiver.

                        Now you can try playing around with light rays inside a circular mirror. It makes pretty patterns.

                    <p>
                        In reality, the rays would keep bouncing, but to keep your computer happy, these ones can only bounce 10 times.
